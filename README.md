XenForo-Ranker
==============

A simple but functional plugin to rank players on the forums.

This can be used with BuyCraft to rank users on the forum automatically (the purpose it was originally created for) as well as for admins to rank their players on their community site (only works with XenForo, however!) with ease.

XenAPI is NECESSARY: http://xenforo.com/community/resources/xenapi-xenforo-rest-api.902/

Configuration is also necessary for this to work.
